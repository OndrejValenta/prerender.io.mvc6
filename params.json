{"name":"Prerender.io.mvc6","tagline":"Prerender.io MVC6 implementation","body":"### Welcome to Prerender.io.mvc6.\r\nThis is my implementation of Prerender.io MVC(https://github.com/greengerong/Prerender_asp_mvc) in new ASP.NET 5.\r\n\r\n### State of play\r\nSo far I've just converted @greengerong code to new ASP.NET 5 style, it should work but had no time to test it yet. There is still some work on TestWeb and perhaps some performance/memory handling testing will be needed. Also handling of configuration file is somewhat troublesome, because all secrets lay in JSON file. I'll add new layer of Environment/UserSecret configuration.\r\n\r\nThe plan is to publish this package as a NuGet package.\r\n\r\n### Implementation details\r\n* PrerenderMiddleware - Implementation of OWIN middleware\r\n* WebRequestHelper - Where all the magic is going on. Each request is first assessed with several rules to see if Prerender service call is needed, if so WebRequest is created.\r\n* prerender.io.config.json - configuration file with all available configuration values\r\n* PrerenderConfiguration.cs - configuration is loaded into this class with this piece of code `services.AddOptions();\r\n     services.Configure<PrerenderConfiguration>(Configuration.GetSection(\"PrerenderConfiguration\"));`\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you have any suggestions or questions you can contact me on [ovalenta@spaneco.com](mailto://ovalenta@spaneco.com).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
