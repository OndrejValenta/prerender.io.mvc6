There is still some work on TestWeb and perhaps some performance/memory handling testing will be needed. Also handling of configuration file is somewhat troublesome, because all secrets lay in JSON file. I'll add new layer of Environment/UserSecret configuration.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you have any suggestions or questions you can contact me on [ovalenta@spaneco.com](mailto://ovalenta@spaneco.com).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
